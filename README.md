#Finale Project
# IoT-Flood-Moniroting-System
As climate change leads to more frequent and severe flooding, it's important to be aware of innovative technologies that can help us stay safe. One such technology prototype that we develop for finale project is IoT Flood Monitoring System, which uses sensors to detect water levels and send alerts in case of danger providing real-time monitoring and data analysis to help prevent disaster.
